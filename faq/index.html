        <strong>
        What&apos;s the difference between the Country &amp; Classic loaves?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>They&apos;re both sourdoughs, but the difference comes down to the variety and the type of whole grain used. Our Country sourdough contains whole hard red wheat and whole rye, whereas the Classic sourdough contains whole hard white wheat. We&apos;ve also been told that the Classic is well-versed in Ancient Greek, has written a few epic poems, likes graffiti, and is quite the philosopher.</p>

        Do you make gluten-free bread?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      Gluten-free products can only be made in kitchens and bakeries that are 100% free of gluten-containing ingredients - definitely not us.
