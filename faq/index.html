            What&apos;s the difference between the Country &amp; Classic loaves?
            </strong>
          </label>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>They&apos;re both sourdoughs, but the difference comes down to the variety and the type of whole grain used. Our Country sourdough contains whole hard red wheat and whole rye, whereas the Classic sourdough contains whole hard white wheat. We&apos;ve also been told that the Classic is well-versed in Ancient Greek, has written a few epic poems, likes graffiti, and is quite the philosopher.</p>

              How should I store my bread at home?

        <div class="content">
          <p>If you purchased it sliced (1) keep it in the bag you are provided at room temperature for several days or (2) keep it frozen and toast as you need it. If you purchased it unsliced, (1) keep it in a paper bag at room temperature for several days or (2) keep some frozen until you need it. The frozen portion should be wrapped in plastic - thaw it in the same plastic overnight at room temperature. Keeping bread in the refrigerator will make it stale much faster!</p>

            What is gluten?
           </strong>
          </label>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Gluten is protein found in wheat, rye, barley and a number of other grains processed in facilities that mill or roll wheat. Actually, it&apos;s a combination of a couple of proteins, but they act as one in when mixed together in water. A very small percentage of people worldwide have a serious medical condition (Celiac disease) which can lead to serious illness after ingesting gluten. Some people who have Gluten Sensitivity are able to eat certain gluten-forming grains (such as spelt) with no symptoms, but we suggest seeking advice from medical professionals before making any decisions to eat gluten-containing bread. We&apos;re bakers, not medical experts. But we do know that someone with Celiac disease shouldn&apos;t even walk into a bakery that deals with gluten anyhow.</p>

            I have a sensitivity to wheat. Do you have any wheat-free products?

        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Not really. We specialize in producing traditional breads which use wheat or wheat-relatives (like rye and spelt) as a primary ingredient, we cannot guarantee that cross-contamination has not occurred in our bakery. On a side note, you might want to see if you&apos;re really allergic to “wheat”, or if its the artificial enrichments added to most commodity flours (to earn the government subsidy) or possibly even the modern crops grown by "big flour" which were selected for their ease of growth and chemical resistance.</p>

            How old is your sourdough starter (levain)?
           </strong>
          </label>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>That&apos;s a personal question for the community of microbes that live (and die) very frequently in our levain (sourdough culture), but we&apos;ll try to make this easy on you. We began culturing our levain from stone-milled whole grain organic California-grown hard red wheat in May 2016, about two months before we opened our doors. And don&apos;t go thinking that the age of a levain makes it any better like a fine wine or something like that. The levain is a community of yeasts & bacteria which is always changing it&apos;s composition based on the environment - it&apos;s the regularity of feeding, careful control of water and air temperature, and quality of grains that make all the difference. Each time a levain is fed, a large portion is removed. Think about it - all those microorganisms (yeast and bacteria) are reproducing & dying at a pretty fast rate. So it turns out that the 500 year-old sourdough starter Great Uncle Boris brought from the Motherland has definitely been replaced with localized microorganisms from being fed with whatever flour is available. However, the story of Great Uncle Boris definitely brings a certain romantic quality to that starter, and we appreciate that!</p>

            What does “naturally leavened” mean?
           </strong>
          </label>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Naturally leavened (or wild-leavened) breads are all sourdoughs, since they do not contain any added commercially produced yeast of any kind. These types of loaves are made by propagating naturally occurring yeast cells from the surface of grains or fruit. We like the term naturally leavened instead of sourdough since our bread tends to be mildly sour at most. The sour flavor of sourdoughs comes from the accumulation of lactic & acetic acid producing bacteria which flourish alongside wild yeast populations in a sourdough levain (starter). We like grain-flavored bread, not vitamin-C tablet flavored bread, so our methods aim to produce less sour flavors (which used to be considered a flaw). And keep in mind that some bakeries make “sourdough” loaves that are not naturally leavened, sometimes including ingredients such as vinegar to create a “sour flavor” along with commercial yeast to ensure fast fermentation.</p>

            Did you burn the bread? Seems awfully dark.

        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Nope, we did that on purpose in our deck oven to provide our customers with a superior and traditional product. The bold bake is due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard Reaction</a> in combination with the fresh whole grains in all of our products. Just as there are variations in roasting coffee beans, there are also variations in baking. We like the bold flavor of well-baked whole grains. This is the way bread was baked before the dawn of modern mass-production bread factories, and is still the way that real bakers bake their bread all around the world. If you&apos;d like a lighter-baked loaf, ask one of our bread slingers and they will try to accommodate.</p>

            Do you use preservatives in your bread?
           </strong>
          </label>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Never! We use traditional methods in our bread process, which naturally preserves our bread and increases the accessibility of the nutrients of the whole grains. We also do not receive any pre-processed dough, which is a disturbingly common method at many “bakeries” which offer “fresh-baked bread.” We&apos;re also proud to say that our bread will absolutely begin to mold after a few days at room temperature and stale very well in a refrigerator. We suggest eating the bread within 2-3 days of purchase (keep it in a paper bag) or freezing the portion that won&apos;t be consumed quickly (in wax paper or a plastic bag), then thaw it overnight when you&apos;re ready to finish it. You can also toast pre-sliced frozen bread straight from the freezer.</p>
